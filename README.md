# A Collection of Short Learning Problems
###### A set of short python scripts written for the purpose of familiarizing myself with python and the unittest framework
***

###### Scripts Included:
- **Coin Combinations.** Finds all possible combinations of US coins to satisfy a given numerical value.
    * Uses a breath first approach with a queue

-  **Fibonacci Sequence.** Generates the Fibonacci sequence using both a loop and recursive approach

-  **Pascal Triangle.** Generate a numerical representation of Pascal triangle to a given depth and prints a nicely formatted string representation to the console.

-  **Fizbuzz.** A super simple Fizbuzz calculator

-  **Primes.** Validations to test if an integer is a prime. Also contains a function to return all primes through a given integer N

-  **String Manipulations.** Code for basic string manipulations such as:
    * Finding the first non repeated character in a string
    * Reversing a string (iteratively and recursively)
    * Determining if a string is an anagram of another string
    * Determining if a string is a palindrome of another string
    * Determining if a string is all unique characters
    * Determining if a string is an int or a float
    * Determining if two strings are a single character manipulation away from each other
    * Determining if two strings are rotations of one another
