# A Collection of Short Learning Problems
###### A set of short python scripts written for the purpose of familiarizing myself with python and the unittest framework
***

###### Scripts Included:
- Code to generate the Fibonacci sequence using both a loop and recursive approach
- Code to generate the the pascal triangle and print it to the console
- Code to test if an integer is a prime is a prime and a function to return all primes through a given integer N
- Code for basic string manipulations such as:
    * finding the first non repeated character in a string
    * reversing a string (iteratively and recursively)
    * determining if a string is an anagram of another string
    * determining if a string is a palindrome of another string
    * determining if a string is all unique characters
    * determining if a string is an int or a float

- A super simple Fizbuzz calculator

***
###### Soon to be Added:
- Factorial Number System
- Code to calculate all possible combinations of coins to satisfy a given value. Uses a breath first approach with a queue
- String Manipulations:
    * Code to calculate if two strings are a single character manipulation away from each other
    * Determine if two strings are rotations of one another
